##Interactives

###Juxtapose Image Slider

JuxtaposeJS is a simple, open source tool for creating before/after image sliders. Just provide two image URLs and Juxtapose will do the rest of the work for you.

The easiest way to create a Juxtapose slider is to go to to http://juxtapose.knightlab.com and use the tool to generate an embedable code snippet that you can use on any website.

Please [contact the digital team](mailto:online@eomediagroup.com) when creating a slider, as we will host images for you and provide a stable url.
